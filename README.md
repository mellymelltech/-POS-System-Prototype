# 💳 POS System Prototype

A point-of-sale (POS) system built to manage retail operations, including inventory management, sales tracking, and user authentication. This prototype helps businesses process transactions efficiently and maintain control over inventory.

## 🚀 Features

- **🛒 Inventory Management**: Add, update, and remove products with real-time stock tracking.
- **💵 Sales Tracking**: Monitor sales, generate reports, and process payments.
- **🔐 User Authentication**: Secure login for cashiers, managers, and admins.
- **📊 Sales Reports**: Generate daily, weekly, and monthly sales reports for business analysis.
- **🛠️ RESTful API**: Backend API for POS operations and data retrieval.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **⚛️ JavaScript**: Frontend (React/Vue) for a seamless user interface.
- **🗄️ MySQL**: Relational database for storing product and sales data.
- **🚀 Express.js**: Backend framework for handling API requests and business logic.
- **🔑 JWT Authentication**: JSON Web Token for secure user sessions.
- **🐳 Docker**: Containerization for easy deployment and scaling.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed.
- MySQL database set up.
- Docker (optional) for containerized deployment.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pos-system.git
    cd pos-system
    ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up the MySQL database and update `.env` file with database credentials:
    ```bash
    DB_USER="yourusername"
    DB_PASS="yourpassword"
    DB_NAME="pos_system"
    ```

4. Run the backend server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

5. (Optional) Run the system with Docker:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

### API Endpoints

- **POST** `/api/products/` - Add a new product to the inventory.
- **GET** `/api/products/` - Retrieve all products and their stock levels.
- **POST** `/api/sales/` - Process a sale and update inventory.
- **GET** `/api/sales/` - Get sales data for generating reports.

### Example Use Cases

- **Inventory Management**: Easily manage stock levels and update product information.
- **Sales Tracking**: Record transactions, calculate totals, and generate sales reports.
- **Authentication**: Secure login for staff with different access levels (e.g., cashier, manager).
